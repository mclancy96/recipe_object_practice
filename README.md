Yes! I can give you the README.md file formatted so you can copy-paste it directly, or I can generate a downloadable file for you.
Since I can’t create a literal download button here, the best next step is for me to give you the file contents exactly as-is, and you can save it as README.md locally.

# 🍽️ Recipe Library — JavaScript Practice

Welcome to the **Recipe Library Practice Project**! In this project, you'll work with a collection of **cuisines**, **recipes**, and their details (like ingredients and steps). Your goal is to practice working with **nested objects and arrays** in JavaScript.

You'll complete a series of functions to help users explore and interact with this recipe library.

---

## 📚 The Data

The recipe library is stored in a file called `recipeLibrary.js`. It contains an array of cuisines. Each cuisine has:

- A `name` (e.g., `"Italian"`, `"Mexican"`)
- An array of **recipes**
  Each recipe has:
  - `title`
  - `ingredients` (array of strings)
  - `steps` (array of strings)
  - `rating` (number from 1 to 5)

Example (simplified):

```js
const recipeLibrary = [
  {
    name: "Italian",
    recipes: [
      {
        title: "Spaghetti Carbonara",
        ingredients: ["spaghetti", "eggs", "pancetta", "pecorino cheese"],
        steps: ["Boil pasta", "Cook pancetta", "Mix eggs and cheese", "Combine everything"],
        rating: 4.7
      },
      ...
    ]
  },
  ...
];
```

We’ve included automated tests to check your solutions!

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Your goal is to make all the tests pass 🎉

Good luck and have fun!
